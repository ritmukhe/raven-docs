# Changelog

All notable changes to RAVEN are recorded here.

## v0.3.2 (2026-06-16)

### Fixed
- Demo lab: all `docker exec` calls in `demo-master.sh` now use `sudo` (silent
  injection failures occurred when run without root)
- Demo lab: `setup()` now injects `LEAK-PREFIX` prefix-list into running FRR
  containers via `vtysh` post-deploy; Containerlab mounts `frr.conf` but FRR
  does not reload on redeploy, causing the leak scenario to fail on cold start
- Demo lab: Routinator 0.15.1 changed CLI syntax; `--config` flag must now be
  passed as a global flag before the subcommand
  (`routinator -c ~/.routinator.conf server`) not after it
- Grafana: BGP Peers panel filtered to IPv4-only peers and panel height
  increased (IPv6 peer additions doubled tile count, causing overflow)

## v0.3.1 (2026-06-08)

### Added
- IPv6 route monitoring via BMP (`MP_REACH_NLRI` / `MP_UNREACH_NLRI` parsing)
- IPv6 ROV validation
- IPv6 origin hijack scenario in demo lab (`./demo-master.sh hijack6`)
- TLS support for BMP listener and RTR client; skip TCP buffer tuning
  (`SetReadBuffer`/`SetWriteBuffer`) for TLS connections (WSL2 compatibility)

### Fixed
- Demo lab: `lacnic` scenario 4 route leak used inline `LEAK-INJECT` route-map
  with wrong prepend ASN (AS64496 → ROV:Invalid); replaced with permanent
  `ROUTE-LEAK` route-map (prepend AS1199 → ROV:Valid, ASPA:Invalid,
  posture:path-suspect as intended)
- Demo lab: `leak` and `hijack6` vtysh commands converted to heredoc syntax
  (`docker exec ... bash -c "vtysh << 'VTYSH' ... VTYSH"`) to fix silent
  failures caused by leading spaces in `-c` arguments
- Demo lab: leak scenario prefix corrected to `193.0.0.0/21` (AS3333 /
  RIPE NCC); SLURM ASPA assertion added for AS3333 with provider AS1103
  (excluding AS65000 to trigger path-suspect)

### Changed
- Demo lab internet router ASN changed from AS2121 to AS64496 to avoid
  spurious `path-suspect` at baseline caused by real-world RPKI/ASPA
  records for AS2121

## v0.3.0 (2026-05-26)

### Added
- Event Engine: configurable triggers on posture changes
  (ROV state change, new route with specific posture,
  RTR cache failure) with webhook HTTP POST and file
  log actions
- Flowspec lifecycle management: detect origin-invalid
  route → generate Flowspec rule → inject via GoBGP →
  monitor → expire after configurable TTL. Dry-run mode
  and approval webhook supported.
- `raven audit` — full security posture report for a
  router: per-peer posture breakdown, ROV/ASPA coverage,
  recommendations. Outputs table, JSON, or markdown.
- `raven check stealthy` — detect stealthy BGP hijacks
  by comparing BMP control-plane view against data-plane
  forwarding via probes
- Warm-start persistence: snapshot route table and RPKI
  caches to disk on shutdown, restore on startup
- OpenTelemetry OTLP metrics export alongside Prometheus
- RTR-over-TLS: configure `transport: tls` and optional
  CA cert under any RTR cache entry
- BMP listener TLS: optional TLS termination on the BMP
  listener with mutual TLS support
- Event Engine ASN triggers: `asn` and `protected_asn`
  trigger types (contributed by Orange/AS3215)

### Fixed
- RTR `rtr-version` config field now correctly wired
  through to the client (was previously ignored)
- TCP socket buffer tuning skipped for TLS connections
  (prevented TLS sessions from establishing on some
  platforms)

## v0.2.0 (2026-05-18)

### Added
- ASPA path verification per draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-24
- Combined security posture matrix: Secured / Origin-Only / Path-Suspect /
  Path-Only / Unverified / Origin-Invalid
- ASPA store populated via RTR v2 ASPA PDUs; re-validation on ASPA
  store updates via dirty-set propagation
- `raven aspa` — show ASPA records for an ASN
- `raven aspa recommend` — suggest ASPA objects based on observed paths
- `raven what-if` — simulate impact of reject-invalid or ASPA enforcement
- `raven watch` — stream live validation state changes
- Prometheus posture metrics reflect full ROV × ASPA matrix

## v0.1.0 (2026-04-15)

Initial public release — Phase 1 (Foundation) complete.

### BMP Ingest
- Embedded BMP receiver (RFC 7854) on configurable TCP port (default: 11019)
- Parses BGP UPDATE messages from BMP Route Monitoring PDUs
- Supports Adj-RIB-In Pre-Policy, Post-Policy, and Loc-RIB
- Per-session lifecycle management (Initiation, Peer Up/Down, Termination)

### RPKI / RTR Client
- RTR v1 (RFC 8210) and RTR v2 (draft-ietf-sidrops-8210bis) client
- VRP store for Route Origin Validation
- Multi-cache support with preference ordering and automatic failover
- Re-validation on RPKI cache updates via dirty-set propagation

### Validation Engine
- Route Origin Validation (ROV) per RFC 6811: Valid / Invalid / NotFound

### CLI
- `raven serve` — start daemon
- `raven status` — BMP peer and RTR cache health
- `raven peers` — list BMP peers
- `raven routes` — query route table with filters (prefix, origin-asn, peer, posture)
- `raven validate` — one-shot prefix validation

### Observability
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (default: 9595)
- Pre-built Grafana dashboards (Security Posture Overview, Per-Peer Deep Dive)

### Demo Lab
- Containerlab topology: internet AS64496 → upstream AS65000 → edge AS65001
- Scripted demo scenarios: origin hijack, route leak
